the other thing I was thinking is, when i first got on the page and there's a little link that comes up and says "How did you find us?", it's really big and was a bit distracting. I mean, my brain almost reacted to it like a popup ad or something. I wonder if it could be a little smaller so that it could still be answered but not reacted to.
